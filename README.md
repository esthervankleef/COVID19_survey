# COVID19 survey
We conducted a retrospective analysis of quantitative modelling work implemented by MOOD and VEO partners during the COVID-19 pandemic to reflect on the data needs, modeling tools used, and interaction with public health authorities. 

A survey was developed and filled out by partners of both EU-FP consortia. We generated standardised responses by asking predominantly close-ended questions on individual COVID-19 modeling works performed during the pandemic by partners involved.

This repository provides the code and data used for analyses.
